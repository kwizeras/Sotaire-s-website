## Biography

Coming from Burundi, one of the world's poorest countries, I embarked on a remarkable journey as a first-generation college student fueled by a relentless determination to pursue higher education. My background and experiences have only intensified my passion for utilizing technology, particularly data analytics and modeling, to advocate for rural and marginalized communities. Throughout my academic journey, I have actively engaged in research projects and undertaken extracurricular activities that empower these communities, all while staying abreast of the rapidly evolving field of technology.

As I progress in my higher education journey, I am now eagerly seeking any opportunity for internships, research positions, or jobs that can provide me with the valuable professional experience I need. I am confident that these experiences will not only enrich my skills but also enable me to make a meaningful impact on the lives of underserved populations.
