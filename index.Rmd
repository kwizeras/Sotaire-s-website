## Bio

I am Sotaire Kwizera from Burundi, one of the poorest countries in the world. Life hardships have taught me that getting educated is the only promising way out of poverty. I believe in the power of numbers to make this world an inclusive and welcoming place to everybody. I want to use my passion for economics and data analytics to develop innovative ideas to boost developing countries' living standards and achieve sustainable development. As I progress in my higher education journey, I am open to any internship, research, and job opportunities that would help me acquire professional experience and step closer to fulfilling my dreams.
