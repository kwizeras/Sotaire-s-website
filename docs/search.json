We accomplished this by combining flood statistics, from remotely sensed satellite data, with household-level survey data to produce a collection of descriptive statistics detecting trends. This allowed us to gain a comprehensive understanding of how flooding impacts pregnant and their children. All our findings were finally compiled into a into interactive Shiny App web dashboard for easy public access on the web.\r\nTools Used\r\n\r\n\r\nR Studio\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nStata\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPython\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGoogle Earth Engine\r\n\r\n\r\nImportant Links:\r\nShiny App Web Dashboard\r\nGitHub Repository\r\nProject 2 \r\nTitle: My Personal Website\r\nDescription\r\nWelcome to my personal website!

By harnessing the power of R Studio’s web development capabilities, I’ve designed this site as an example of what can be achieved when creativity meets coding.\r\nHaving my Portfolio out there on the web: Rather than merely telling the world what I can do, I believe in showing it through tangible examples. Thus, this website serves as a living portfolio, showcasing my skills and projects to the global audience.
