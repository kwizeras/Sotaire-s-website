We accomplished this by combining flood statistics, from remotely sensed satellite data, with household-level survey data to produce a collection of descriptive statistics detecting trends. This allowed us to gain a comprehensive understanding of how flooding impacts pregnant and their children. All our findings were finally compiled into a into interactive Shiny App web dashboard for easy public access on the web.\r\nTools Used\r\n\r\n\r\nR Studio\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nStata\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPython\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGoogle Earth Engine\r\n\r\n\r\nImportant Links:\r\nShiny App Web Dashboard\r\nGitHub Repository\r\nProject 2 \r\nTitle: My Personal Website\r\nDescription\r\nWelcome to my personal website! Here, I’ve crafted this platform with two primary objectives in mind:\r\nDemonstrating the Versatility of R Studio: Beyond its traditional use for statistical analysis and data visualization, I aim to showcase the immense potential of R Studio in creating aesthetically pleasing and functional websites. By harnessing the power of R Studio’s web development capabilities, I’ve designed this site as an example of what can be achieved when creativity meets coding.\r\nHaving my Portfolio out there on the web: Rather than merely telling the world what I can do, I believe in showing it through tangible examples. Thus, this website serves as a living portfolio, showcasing my skills and projects to the global audience. Here, you’ll find a detailed collection of my works, illustrating my experiences and passion across various domains.\r\nTools Used\r\n\r\n\r\nR Studio\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHTML\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCSS\r\n\r\n\r\nImportant Links:\r\nWesite\r\nGitHub Repository\r\nProject 3 \r\nTitle\r\nDescription\r\nTools Used\r\nProject 4 \r\nTitle:\r\nDescription\r\nTools Used\r\n\r\n101 Chestnut Street / CPO: 779 / \r\nBerea, KY, 40404 / \r\n(859) 979-6935\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
