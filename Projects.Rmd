## Project 1 <a name="project-1"></a>

**Title:** Data science research - DSPG Program

**Team:** Sotaire Kwizera, Riya Pulla, Jade Nguyen,Nandini Das, Naveen Abedin 

**Description**

During our 10-week DSPG program, my team's objective was to complete a preliminary study of prenatal exposure to flooding and child health outcomes. We accomplished this by combining flood statistics, from remotely sensed satellite data, with household-level survey data to produce a collection of descriptive statistics detecting trends. This allowed us to gain a comprehensive understanding of how flooding impacts pregnant and their children. All our findings were finally compiled into a into interactive Shiny App web dashboard for easy public access on the web.


**Tools Used**

>> * R Studio

## Project 2 <a name="project-2"></a>

**Title:** My Personal Website

**Description**

Welcome to my personal website! Here, I've crafted this platform with two primary objectives in mind:

Demonstrating the Versatility of R Studio: Beyond its traditional use for statistical analysis and data visualization, I aim to showcase the immense potential of R Studio in creating aesthetically pleasing and functional websites. By harnessing the power of R Studio's web development capabilities, I've designed this site as an example of what can be achieved when creativity meets coding.

Having my Portfolio out there on the web: Rather than merely telling the world what I can do, I believe in showing it through tangible examples. Thus, this website serves as a living portfolio, showcasing my skills and projects to the global audience. Here, you'll find a detailed collection of my works, illustrating my experiences and passion across various domains.
